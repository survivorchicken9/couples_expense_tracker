# Expense tracking for couples

This is a basic expense tracker for couples. To begin using it, run the "runexptrack.py" file.
All existing functionality can be found in the "expensetrackerfortwo.py" file.

Currently, features include:
- Entering a transaction
- Viewing all transactions
- Viewing transactions grouped by category
- Viewing actual transactions per person
- Viewing who is in debt (who has spent less)
- View the "per person spending" if spending were equal (total spending / 2)

Use "pip install -r requirements.txt" to get the packages required.
