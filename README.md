# Expense tracking for couples

This is a basic expense tracker for couples (or any number of people- there's really just an extra column where you can specify the person who entered a transaction). To begin using it, run "main.py" and a Gooey GUI will open.

Set up:
- Use "pip install -r requirements.txt" to get the packages required.
- Create a text file called "db_filepath.txt" and place the full filepath of your SQLite database in it.

Gooey set up and customization is in "main.py". Current functionality for implementing expense entering and viewing all expenses in the SQLite database can be found in the the "expensetrackerfortwo.py" file.
