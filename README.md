# Expense tracking for couples

This is a basic expense tracker for couples. To begin using it, run "main.py". You will be prompted to input the person who paid, the date of the transaction, the amount of the transaction, and the category of the transaction. This information is then written into an SQLite database. 

Usage:
- Use "pip install -r requirements.txt" to get the packages required.
- Create a text file called "db_filepath.txt" and place the full filepath of your SQLite database in it.

All existing functionality can be found in the "expensetrackerfortwo.py" file.
